# Busking Radar
## Summary

Busking Radar makes outdoor live entertainment easily discoverable for any user and helps buskers draw a larger audience to their performances. 

During the pandemic, street performances are one of the few cultural activities, which people can experience. The app could help the public find out about those performances.

Busking Radar was created to support street art performers in a fast and accessible way. With the user-friendly interface, buskers can create a profile to promote their performances. When creating an account, the users can benefit from the following features: create events and share them through the app and social media, add photos and videos of events and tag events with keywords in order to be easily found by their fans. The interactive map on the app is a great tool for creating events in no time, and for the fans, find the events closest to their location. 

The project consisted of 7 TechLabs students from the Web development, UX Design and Data Science tracks. More specifically, the app was created using the following technologies: HTML, SASS, JavaScript and React for the frontend, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB for the backend, jsonplaceholder for the data science and Miro (wireframes, user-flow and personas), Affinity Designer (logo) and Figma (prototype) for the UX design.
